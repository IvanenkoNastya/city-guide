This instruction provides information about possible ways of using this application.

	- try again if the login is declined, or edit manually database to be able to login

	"Usernames"

"quiet-squirrel", "foggy-frog",
"white-koala", "fish", and "oak",
"leo-zebra", "brutal-fox",
"poltergeist", "red-bear", "goat-ghost".

one "no-longer-" is "-admin",
or "magnolia-jasmine".
hyphen's part of many names
cause you can't apply the space.

others' passwords are just free
if you're admin: add and see:
user "walnut123"
with the password "one-two-three"

"camel-snake-pascal-kebab"
guess password for user such,
it's as simple as just "case",
or they made it deep and strange?

user "guava-apricot"
smells the same as fresh boycott.
"purple-fish" and "orange-shark"
try to spark an ocean's darks.

also "user-to-delete"
is created to feel free
while destroying work of me
cause I'd save here all of these.

"lemon-orange-mango-tree"
leads all other "plants-and-bees",
"snowy-yew" and "winter-time"
dance together just to shine.
